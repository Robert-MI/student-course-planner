Each student follows only one track: either ACS or MM (not both).One Gen-Ed course must be taken each semester.Track electives should be selected according to the studentâ€™s track (ACS or MM).All mandatory/core and math courses must be completed as outlined.If multiple required courses are available in a given semester, prioritize those not yet completed.If prerequisites exist, respect the logical order (e.g., take Data Structures before Algorithms).Fill available course slots (usually 5 per semester) with Free Electives or remaining requirements.Do not schedule the same course more than once.
